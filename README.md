# League Of Legends Analysis

Using the League of Legends API, I am sourcing data to analyze what it takes to win a game. This is for educational purposes and for fun. If you have any questions feel free to reach out, my contact information is linked below. 

## Currently Working On:

Right now my focus is to set up the dataset itself. I am setting up functions in order to create my own pipeline. These functions will be able to take any LoL match and consolidate it into useful information that can fit in a single row. 

I also plan to fill out this Readme as I go.
