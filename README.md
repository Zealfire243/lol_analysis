# League Of Legends Analysis

Using the League of Legends API, I am sourcing data to analyze what it takes to win a game. This is for educational purposes and for fun. If you have any questions feel free to reach out, my contact information is linked below. 

## My Thought Process:

At first my focus was to set up the dataset itself. I had to go through every datapoint the api gave me and decided whether or not I needed it. I set up functions as I went through in order to create a pipeline. These functions will be able to take any LoL match and consolidate it into useful information that can fit in a single row. My first accomplishment is for the everyday player. I can create a dataframe given a list of matches but it is not for a specific person, it is an averaged out performance of team 1. 

 

## Overview
The primary goal for this project is to create a tool for professional League of Legends players to be able to fully analyze their own personal games as well as other rival players. With the help of a data analyst, they will be able to identify their own weaknesses and know exactly what to work on to be a better player. They can also identify weaknesses of the competition and use that information to have some what of an edge, which leads to winning more tournaments. 

The side effect of making a tool for professionals is that amatures can also use it. They can check their own individual performance or  summary of an entire teams performance. That way they can see what, on average, helps an everyday league player win games. 


## Goals

Answer what variables effect whether or not you win the game. For a professional, what weaknesses might they have. How to use that information to help League Of Legends players, specifically the professionals or those wanting to become a pro. 

Tool to help everyday players analyze random league games to know more about what it takes to win. Proof of which is below where I did some Exporatory Data Analysis on my friend Nathan's games. The end goal is to have an interactive website that allows for different visuals to be generated with simple buttons instead of coding with Python.
